            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>So where this living &amp; precious divine Faith is, which Christ who is

            <p>This living Faith hath living works, which works by Love, and they are obedient to this living Faith, that walk and live by Faith, and not by sight, which carries their minds above the outward things the Law commanded, to Christ this Heavenly and Spiritual man, who is the author of this divine and precious faith, and finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof; and is the end of the Law for Righteousness sake to all them that believe, who is the author of the Light that he commands men to believe in, and saith, <hi>This is to do the work of God, to believe in the Son of God which he hath sent;</hi> and God is the Justifier of him that believes in Christ Jesus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1.26.</p>
            <p>So here this is by Belief in Christ Jesus, that People are justified, and they that believe in Christ Jesus, believe as Christ Jesus ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So who shall lay any thing to the Charge of God's Elect? it is God that justifies, and the Elect is in Christ that never sell, and the Reprobation is in <hi>Adam</hi> in the fall.</p>
            <p>And this we can say, who are elect in Christ Jesus before the world began, that justifies us: And we can say, whom God justifies he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies, Glory to God for ever: And he is near that justifies <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle saith, <hi>To him that worketh n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Even</hi> David <hi>also describeth the Blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth Righteousness without works saying, blessed are they whose Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered,</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>Now cometh this Righteousness upon the Circumcision</hi> (sai h the Apostle) <hi>or upon the Æ²ncircumcision also?</hi> for he saith, <hi>that Faith was reckoned to</hi> Abraham <hi>for Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now God justifies th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s the Victory over the Ungodliness; for all <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were gone astray; for the Apostle saith, <hi>all have sinned, and come short of the Glory of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So all having sinned, then they were ungodly; and God justifies
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47384:6"/> the Circumcision and the Uncircumcision, that is <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by Faith and through Faith, which purifies their Hearts. and is their Victory over Ungodliness, and makes them just, which just lives by his Faith.</p>
            <p>And so to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifies the Ungodly, not in their ungodliness, but in the Faith, &amp; in the Belief that overcomes the world, that purifies and saves, and gives Victory, and Access to God; in which God is pleased, and is man's Justification.</p>
            <p>Now they that believe pass from death to Life, and so from sin that brought death, which made them ungodly, and so become the Children of the Light.</p>
            <p>And though they have been ungodly, and have seen themselves ungodly, yet the Faith purifies them, which Jesus Christ is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and finisher of, his holy, divine and precious Faith, that is the Victory over Ungodliness, by which Faith they are saved, and have access to God, by the Gift that comes from him; and their Faith is counted for Righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. and in that they are justified.</p>
            <p>Now God doth not justifie the Ungodly, without the Faith which is the Victory, and purifies their Hearts, and gives the access to God, and he doth not justifie the Ungodly, unless they believe in the Light, as Christ commands, and so become Children of the Light, and are born of God, and so overcome the ungodly world.</p>
            <p>For the same Apostle saith in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>For the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all Æ²ngodliness, and Æ²nrighteousness of men, who hold the Truth in Æ²nrighteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now mark, these Professors may hold a Truth in the Unrighteous and Ungodly Spirit, and say, they are Believers in God, and they have Faith, but it is a dead one, and doth not purifie them, and is not the Victory; and their Belief is not in the Light, and so not a Child of Light, nor born of God, which Birth overcomes the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly world.</p>
            <p>And such ungodly and unrighteous men, which God reveals his Wrath from Heaven against, God doth not justifie; for they are not in his faith, nor his gift, which purifies, and is the Victory over the Ungodliness and Unrighteousness of men.</p>
            <p>For saith the Apostle, <hi>There shall come out of</hi> Zion <hi>a Deliverer; that shall turn away Æ²<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47384:6"/>
            <p>So Christ the Saviour doth not justifie them in their Ungodliness; nor in their Sin, but takes away their Sin, and turns them from their Ungodliness, and then justifies them in the faith that is the Victory.</p>
            <p>Now see all you Christians, if Christ hath turned you from your Ungodliness, and your sins are taken away by him, and that you do believe in his Light, and that you are become Children of the Lightâ–ª and that he is the Author of your faith, by which you are justified; for <hi>Jacob</hi> nor no man is justified in their Ungodliness, nor in their Sins; and the Devil deceives them that think they are justified in them.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle bids, <hi>Shun profane and vain Bablings; for they will encrease to more Æ²ngodliness, and their word will eat as doth a Canker, of whom is</hi> Hymineus <hi>and</hi> Philetus, and these <hi>Overthrew the faith of some,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.16, 17.</p>
            <p>And too many such we have in our dayes, which God did not then, nor doth now justifie in their Ungodliness; for these over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Faith of them, in which is the Victory, and in which they should have been purified and justified, in which Faith (his gift) they should have pleased God.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle saith, <hi>For the Grace of God which bringeth Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath appeared to all men</hi> [mark] to all men, <hi>Teaching us</hi> (to wit, the True Christians) <hi>that denying Æ²ngodliness and Worldly Lusts, we should live soberly, and righteously, and godly in this present World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So now mark, All men are justified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus, out of the Ungodliness and Worldly Lusts, &amp;c. and so to live soberly, and righteously, and godly in this present world.</p>
            <p>Now you that live ungodly, and in the Lusts of the World, and in Unrighteousness and Unsoberness, God doth not justifie you there:</p>
            <p>But they that are justified, are justified by his Grace, that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to deny Ungodline<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the Counsel of the ungodly;</hi> but saith. <hi>The ungodly are like unto Chaff,</hi> &amp;c. for the ungodly cannot stand in Judgment: So these are not justifie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And not that they should live unjustly and ungodly all their life time, and plead for it till they go to the Grave; but that they should live to him, that dyed for them, and walk in him who is Holy and Just, who turns them from their Ungodliness, and takes away their Sins; for Christ dye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And he saith, Believe in the Light, that enlightens you; and he is the Author of their Faith, that purifies their Hearts, and is the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over the ungodly nature and conversation, whose conversation is in Heaven, as the Apostle saith, in which Faith they are justified; and not as they l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And <hi>Abraham</hi> staggering not at the Promise of God, through Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, but was strong in the faith, giving Glory to God; and being trully perswaded, that what God had promised, he was able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: Therefore it was imputed to him for Righteousness,</p>
               <p>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him, but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed it we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So to this Righteousness of faith, and those who walk in the steps; of this faith, Righteousness is imputed, and it is counted to them for Righteousness,</p>

               <p>So never apply to your sinful dead faith, that has no victory, any Righteousness of God's; for it belongs not to it.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>James</hi> 2.23. It is said, <hi>And this Scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and be was called the Friend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And so this faith that was counted, or imputed, or put to him for Righteousness, it was to the Belief that he had in God, and the faith which is his gift, by which he had access to God, by which he talked with God, and God with him; and by which faith he walkt before God, and was to be perfect, and was counted God's Friend.</p>
               <p>And the Apostle saith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. ver. 17. to ver. 19. <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>If any man be in Christ he is a New Creature; old things are past a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and behold all things are become new, and all things are of God, who hath reconciled us unto himself, by Jesus Christ, and hath given unto us the Ministry of Reconciliation</hi> (to wit) <hi>That God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their Tresp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s unto them; for he hath
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47384:10"/> made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So now mark, Christ was made sin for us, who knew no sin, and was without sin, but all people were in sin, and had sin.</p>
               <p>So he made Peoples sins to be his, &amp; their Debts and their Trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses his, and dyed for them, and did not impute the Trespasses and sins to the People, but made their sin to be his, that knew none; and so reconciles us unto God; and so God was in Christ reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the world unto himself.</p>
               <p>And now they that are in Christ Jesus are new Creatures; and the old things and Ceremonies of the Law are past away, and so the new Creatures are made the Righteousness of God in him (to wit, Christ) and this is whilest they be upon the Earth and before they go to the grave, that they have these new things:</p>
               <p>But they that plead for sin and the Body of it, and Imperfection to the grave, and all the old things, and cannot endure to hear of having them pass away, and yet plead for, and would have Christ's Righteousness imputed unto them, the old Creatures in their old things; and plead and say, Christ hath taken away their sin, and yet say, they must have it to the grave, and the Body of it, and yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Christ's Righteousness to the old Creature, and their old things; and their Imperfection, and Body of Death and sin, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle never applied Righteousness unto, but said, <hi>That must be cut off by the Circum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And so the Apostles were as Embassadours and Ministers, who did beseech People to be reconciled to God, und turned them from sin and evil, and from darkness to the Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, and brought them to look unto Jesus, who was the author and finisher of their faith, unto which Righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eousness was imputed, which faith is the victory, and the Just lives and walks by it.</p>
               <p>And again the Apostle saith, <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their Trespasses,</hi> &amp;c. And Christ came to take away the sins of the world, who is able to pay all the debts of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47384:10"/> world; who dyed for all (which sin was the debt that <hi>Old Adam</hi> and his sons and daughters had contracted) and enlightens all, that all might follow him, and believe in him in his Light, and receive his Grace and Truth that comes by him, which will teach them to deny Ungodliness, and will bring their Salvation, &amp;c. and by Belief in the Light to be grafted into Christ the Life, and he the Root to bear them; this Belief and Faith is counted to them, yea and enjoyed for Righteousness; but Christ did not dye for the sins of the world, that People should live in sin and plead for it, and the body of it till they go to the grave; For they that sin wilfully after they have received the Knowledge of the Truth, they must expect Judgment and Condemnation; and such as crucifie to themselves the Son of God af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And such as turn the Grace into Laciviousness, as in <hi>Jude.</hi> So all that expect the Righteousness of God or Christ put or imputed to them, they must walk in the Faith that <hi>Abraham</hi> walked in, which is the gift of God, and be in that true Belief that he was in, which he that believes is born of God, and over comes the world.</p>
               <p>And this Belief is counted unto them for Righteousness, and by which they are grafted into Christ, the holy and pure Root; and so they can say, <hi>Greater is he that is in them; then he that is in the World,</hi> which Greater overcomes the lesser.</p>
               <p>And here is no pleading for sin to the grave, nor a <hi>Purgatory</hi> after they are in the grave; but Christ th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And all that be reconciled to God, know the Word of Reeoncili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which Word hammers down sin and corruption, that hath made the separation betwixt them and God: By which Word all is burnt up, which Word is as a Fire; and by which Word they are sanctified and made clean; and so by Christ the Word, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, and in him they are new Creatures, and are made the Righteousness of God; and he it is that makes all things new unto them, and brings them out of the old: And then they can say in Truth, That God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their Trespasses unto them; fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
